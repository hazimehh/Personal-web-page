Welcome to my page! I am a fourth-year PhD candidate at the MIT Operations Research Center, advised by [Rahul Mazumder](http://www.mit.edu/~rahulmaz/). My research lies at the intersection of machine learning and optimization. Specifically, I am working on developing fast optimization algorithms for sparse and interpretable machine learning models. For instance, check out our sparse learning toolkit [L0Learn](#software).

I'm currently doing a research internship at [Google AI](https://ai.google), where I am working on a new approach for training deep neural nets with decision trees.

Before coming to MIT, I did my masters at UIUC where I worked with [ChengXiang Zhai](http://czhai.cs.illinois.edu/) on improving information recall in search engines. I also did a research internship with the Core Machine Learning team at Amazon, where my work with [Charles Elkan](http://cseweb.ucsd.edu/~elkan/) reduced the time for serving machine learning models by $\sim$ 3000x.
