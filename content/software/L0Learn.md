#summary = "L0Learn fits regularization paths for L0-regularized least squares problems. Specifically, it can solve $$ \\min_{\beta} \frac{1}{2} || y - X \beta ||^2 + \lambda ||\beta||\_0 + \gamma||\beta||\_q^q $$, where $q \in \{ 1,2\}$, over a grid of $\lambda$ and $\gamma$ values. Pathwise optimization can be done using either cyclic coordinate descent (CD) or local combinatorial search. The core of the toolkit is implemented in C++ and employs many computational tricks and heuristics, leading to competitive running times. CD runs very fast and typically leads to relatively good solutions. Local combinatorial search can find higher-quality solutions (at the expense of increased running times)."
