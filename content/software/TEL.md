# Project summary to display on homepage.
#summary = "The layer is differentiable so SGD can be used to train the neural network (including TEL). The layer supports conditional computation for both training and inference, i.e., when updating/evaluating a certain node in the tree, only the samples that reach that node are used in computations (this is to be contrasted with the dense computations in neural networks). We provide a low-level TensorFlow implementation along with a high-level Keras API."
